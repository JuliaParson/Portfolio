                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    This business system was created for Haver & Boeker, a company that specializes in mineral processing.
                    They were looking for an application that would be able to assist with the creation of their NCR reports.
                    The system is designed to create, update, and track the NCRs throughout each stage of the report. There is also additional functionality 
                    for voiding and archiving these reports. This was a group project with five other students, and I had 
                    the role of designer and presenter. Using MVC, ASP.net and C-sharp, we were able to create what they were 
                    looking for while keeping certain accessibility standards in mind. A main function that really 
                    enhanced our application was the PDF creation. I developed this functionality, allowing the generation of PDF versions of the reports. 
                    This feature was built using HTML and CSS, allowing the PDFs to dynamically receive and display the data.
